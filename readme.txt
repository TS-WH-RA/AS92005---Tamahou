Define 

Users: 

Anyone what which enjoys games, or animals, or games about animals. 

 

 

Context:  

The game, if ever made in its entirety, should be a lore heavy survival-puzzle-horror game. Throw in some funky easter eggs that build up a full story, and voila! You got yourself a fairly decent game. 

Hide some hidden symbolic dialogue about the preservation of order, or how the aliens are, in actuality, physical embodiments of chaos and discord, and bingo-bongo, 3.9-star rating. 

 

 

Brief:  

So, ya play as this little boyo, like little nightmares but 2d, and with an art style reminiscent of those very old, very raggedy, black-and-white illustrations. 

But then, BOOM! Alien invaders! All of which drawn in completely distinctive styles than the world that which they hath invaded. 

You solve some puzzles, survive a few chases, and hide from the big mean bastard. All of that culminating in the final stretch of the game; the little boy’s old, dingy hut being crushed by a mother ship, the boy finally killing a monster through some Goldberg machines. Then the boy passes out from all his injuries, and is then found by a girl from a nearby native tribe... *title card* 

... ah! The game should also be completely silent for its entirety, apart from the loud and bombastic monster sequences, and the calm and orchestral final reveal. 

 

 

Player Character: The Orphan 

Enemies: Xenomelius (Alien Superiors) 

Each unique alien should be drawn in their own style, completely different from the world the game takes place in, which is drawn as a 2d, raggedy, black-and-white, child-like drawing. 

One alien should be drawn and rendered as close to photorealistic as possible, and another could be drawn like an anime monster, and as an easter egg there can be another one that is literally just a jpeg copy-pasted into the game, static animation and all. 

 

Art Board: 

 

Main poster. Personally, 7/10 design could definitely do better. It’s supposed to be, like, the alien invaders are hiding in his shadow, but looking at it now, it just looks like he’s having a calm stroll through some monster's maw, which doesn’t look the slightest bit scary. 

 

Honestly? The worst design. It’s just so bland. The only saving grace for this blimmin’ thing is the wendigo design, which even then is right bloody boring. 

 

Best poster—totally not because it’s the only one I cared enough for. But even then, it’s still a 9/10 personally. I like how small the boy is in the wider picture, but the aliens are really hard to spot, which granted is the alien’s goal. But still. The “eyes” just look like rendering errors.  

What I do like is the big skunt in the background. I’m calling him the “Moon Man” for simplicity. It may be a tad bit hard to see what I’m talking ‘bout, so I’ll make it a bit easier. 

 

“AH... THE GOLDEN EYE... O’ GLORIOUS GOLDEN EYE... FOR WHAT HATH MADE YOU FORSAKE MINESELF, YOUR RADIANCE? 

No... no... NO... 

YOU. WHELP. YOUR VILENESS, YOUR SINFULNESS. YOU DROVE AWAY THE GREAT GOLDEN EYE. YOU AND YOUR LOT’S FILTH. 

YOU WILL SUFFER, DEAR SINNER. BY MY HAND. BY THE 

-=AUREATE JUDGE=-” 

Above is the previous image—this time, without the trees! And as you can now see, the big bastard in the background is, indeed, a big bastard. Huge even, nay... Gargantuan! 

And the text below is something I heard being preached in a dream o’ mine. 

So. The big, four-armed snake man with a star for a head. What inspired it? Goin’ ta’ be honest; A fever dream.
